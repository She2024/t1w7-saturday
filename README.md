# Wild card Arguments
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-Keyword arguments, *args
- Keyword arguments, **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solved the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Library

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- organise related miodules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file

## Practical Example
Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
    - Counting words in a string,
    - Counting characters in a string, and
    - Reversing strings.

# Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples.
- Sytax: sequence [start:stop:step] (like range)
- Default of start: 0, step: 1, stop: last

# Object Oriented Programming
- It is a way to help programmers structure the functionality of your program that would make sense to humans and would allow computers to run it efficiently.
- Almost all programming languages use this concept.
- It uses "objects" to model real-world entities

## Key concepts
- Class
    - A blueprint for creating objects. 
    - Defines a set of attributes or methods that the created objects (instances) will have
    - EG. Blueprint provided whie bulding a house, deining what an animal is

- Object
    - An instance of a class. 
    - It represents a specific entity with attributes (data) and methods (functions) defined by class.
    - Eg. a built hoese with many features (as functions), a tiger
