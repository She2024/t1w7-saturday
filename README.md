# Wild card Arguments
- When you don't know how many arguments to pass in a function
- Non-Keyword arguments, *args
- Keyword arguments, **kwargs

# Modules
- One of the techniques for following DRY Coding Principles
- Group similar codes and functions together in a separate file
- Solved the problem of code file being too lengthy and complex
- Can be reused across several programs
Python comes with a lot of modules as well, Pythons Standard Library

# Packages
- Collection of modules
- organise related miodules under one directory
- Initialise a package using __init__.py file

## Practical Example
Task:
- Create a package for basic text processing with modules for:
    - Counting words in a string,
    - Counting characters in a string, and
    - Reversing strings.

# Slicing a sequence
- Way to extract parts of data structures, like strings, lists, tuples.
- Sytax: sequence [start:stop:step] (like range)
